# hDDM_attention
Current repository was able to assess the relationship between EEG components and HDDM parameters of top-down attention using multiple regression model


Scientists usually record EEG data as the continuous (Raw) signal which consists of irrilavant signal (brain signal) and irrilevant signal (artifact), therefore we need to attenuate the effects artifacts to make clear signals.  

For preprocessing EEG data, the **MNE-Preprocessing repocitory** was implemented by the [**MNE-package**](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html) in python.

The preprocessing was performed as follows:

256 points as the **sampling rate**, **band-pass filter** in the range 1 Hz - 30 Hz, **re-referencing**
with average of sensors, **visual inspection** to remove abnormal frequency, **interpolation** fully
corrupted signal, **discarding range** of -100 mV to +100 mV amplitude, **extracting Epochs**
from - 100 ms (baseline) of cueâ€™s onset to 600 ms after stimulus appearance (or any period time you want), running Independent Component Analysis **(ICA)** to remove manually irrelevant-task
(e.g. eye movement, head motion and muscular activity), detecting automatically eyeblinking
**EOG** component and heartbeat peak **ECG** component.
